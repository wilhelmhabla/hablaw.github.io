                    <p>“I had Prolotherapy sessions in June and 3 months later we numbed the nerves on either side of my right knee. This gave me 6 months of pain relief! The office staff are very professional and Dr. McDonnell is gentle and compassionate.”</p>

        <p>“I have suﬀerred from chronic knee pain for over 30 years. After my treatments I have been able to sleep through the night without the pain of my knees waking me up 3 to 4 times per night. His treatments have allowed me to have a better quality of life and I am very satisfied with the results!”</p>

        <p>“Dr. McDonnell has been consistently supportive and patient as we have worked through my injuries. I am probably alive today because he was able to coach me through mast cell degranulation. I unreservedly recommend Dr. McDonnell and his staff.”</p>

        <p>“For last eight years I was treated by various doctors with various medications in an attempt to manage my debilitating left hip pain. Unfortunately nothing worked for me. I found out about Comprehensive Spine and Dr. McDonell. He recommended PRP which involves no medication, just my own plasma. I underwent the treatment and within two weeks the pain started rescinding and after two months pain went away almost entirely. You can imagine how happy I am to once again have a normal life."</p>

        <p>"I highly recommend Dr. McDonnell I have been to other Orthopedic Doctors and he is by far the best! He treated me for knee pain and now my pain is almost nonexistent. He takes the time to listen and to explain everything.”</p>
