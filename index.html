            <h2>Ultrasound-Guided Injections</h2>
        <p>Ultrasound-guided injections use ultrasound technology to precisely administer medications or anesthetics into specific areas of the body. This real-time imaging technique improves accuracy and reduces risks in various medical procedures, especially in fields like pain management and orthopedics.</p>

        <h2>Regenerative Injection Therapy</h2>
        <p>Regenerative Injection Therapy (RIT) involves injecting substances like Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) or Prolotherapy into damaged tissues to stimulate natural healing. Widely used in orthopedics and sports medicine, RIT aims to promote tissue repair and reduce pain and inflammation.</p>

        <h2>Spinal Interventions</h2>
        <p>Spinal interventions are procedures that use injections to address spine-related issues and relieve pain. Common in pain management, these interventions target specific areas like facet joints or nerves to improve function and alleviate conditions such as herniated discs or spinal stenosis.</p>
